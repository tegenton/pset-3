/**
 * INSTRUCTIONS.
 * 
 * Problem Set 3 will be extensive. You've been warned. Practice
 * makes perfect, and we'll get a lot of practice with conditional
 * and iterative control structures.
 * 
 * A few new concepts are being introduced with this assignment.
 * Last time, we saw methods (other than the main method) for the
 * first time. Now, we're seeing parameters, which are the variables
 * inside the parentheses in our methods. We'll cover these in more
 * detail later. For now, you just need to understand the basics.
 * 
 * A parameter is data that is provided to the method. It helps the
 * method do its job. It's passed in through the parentheses, and
 * you can reference these variables by name as if they're your own.
 * 
 * Each of the return statements included in this skeleton are
 * placeholders. You'll need to modify them as you write your code.
